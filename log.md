# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 10, 2023
##### Getting to know Github

**Today's Progress**: Worked through part of the tutorial offered by Github to familiarize yourself with the site. Forked the 100-days-of-code repository to begin this log. While there was some active code work, this was more a read and learn day.

**Thoughts:** Like a lot of new topics under the huge umbrella of computer science, Git and Github seem overwhelming to me at first. But even after a short time parts of it are already becoming more familiar. Tomorrow I should finish setting up my Hello World repository so I can begin logging exercises, projects and guided tutorials.

**Link to work:** N/A, as the landing page would be right here!
