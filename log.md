# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 11, 2023
##### *Getting to know Github*

**Today's Progress**: Worked through part of the tutorial offered by Github to familiarize yourself with the site. Forked the 100-days-of-code repository to begin this log. While there was some active code work, this was more a read and learn day.

**Thoughts:** Like a lot of new topics under the huge umbrella of computer science, Git and Github seem overwhelming to me at first. But even after a short time parts of it are already becoming more familiar. Tomorrow I should finish setting up my Hello World repository so I can begin logging exercises, projects and guided tutorials.

**Link to work:** N/A, as the landing page would be right here!

### Day 2: April 12, 2023
##### *Git, GitHub and GitDesktop*

**Today's Progress**: More Github stuff today! Went through the quickstart, creating repositories just to play around with pull requests, branches, merging etc. Downloaded GitHub Desktop and did half of the exercise there to start getting familiar.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'm going to continue with a Git tutorial and uploading an HTML project via Git to get used to these tools. After that I think back to my current FCC project: Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting.

**Link to work:** [Here](https://github.com/MojoBoingo/hello-world) is a link to my little hello-world repository: currently only populated by a README file listing some basic goals and plans I have for the immediate future. If you want to push some learning suggestions to the main branch, feel free!

### Day 3: April 13, 2023
##### *Git Going Already*

**Today's Progress**: I round off my three-day exploration of GitHub and all things Git by creating a local repository using Git Bash and then pushing it to GitHub as a brand new one. Now I have created, pushed and pulled repositories using GitHub, GitHub Desktop, and Git Bash; I wanted to be at least passingly familiar with each method.

**Thoughts:** Had some fun comparing the troubleshooting skills of ChatGPT and Phind when I had any issues: while Phind goes into much more detail and cites it's sources, ChatGPT's concise and quick answers served me better on this occasion. Desktop seems the most user friendly. Below's my new repo containing the project I'll be finishing over the weekend.

### Day 4: April 15, 2023
##### *Oof*

**Today's Progress**: I took yesterday off after getting into a bad headspace. Today I've doubled my minimum coding time to make up for it. I'm basically finished with the HTML tutorial I was doing.

**Thoughts:** However, I reminded myself that originally I decided to pursue it as a way of easing myself back into coding regularly. Instead I procrastinated and this very simple set of prompts and exercises became this white whale in my head. So while I did get value form this tutorial, refreshing some knowhow and learning some new elements and attributes even, I have to ask was it the best use of my time?

**Link to work:** Here's a link to the repo where I'm storing today's work. Has a link to the tutorial, provided by our very own FCC.

### Day 5: April 16, 2023
##### *Back on FCC*

**Today's Progress**: Got back on the FCC curriculum and finished my Picasso Painting.

**Thoughts:** Wonder if I can do the last exercise AND the project tomorrow? Or at least get started.

### Day 6: April 17, 2023
##### *Keepin' On*

**Today's Progress**: Little less than an hour today. Got started on the next module in Responsive Web Design before a friend's situation demanded my attention. Wiped out now, after doing some light studying to try and make up for it.

**Thoughts:** Not happy with how the day turned out. But it's in the past and I did what I could to maintain the habit.

### Day 7: April 18, 2023
##### *Piano Man*

**Today's Progress**: Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano 33/33.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'm going to start recreating the Github Quickstart page for my Technical Documentation project.
 Going to start waiting till Friday to mass update from Discord to my repo log.

### Day 8: April 19, 2023
##### *Awoo*

**Today's Progress**: Change of pace, attended an hour long webinar on the Wolfram Plugin for ChatGPT.

**Thoughts:** At least part of the motivation was avoidance today. Wasn't in the best headspace, but that's becoming rarer and rarer. Was mostly here for the ChatGPT side of things. Having access to the recordings is for each session is nice too.

### Day 9: April 20, 2023
##### *Project time!*

**Today's Progress**: Started my Technical Documentation Page project today in Responsive Web Design. Today was focused on laying out the bones of the html and making plans to satisfy the user stories.

**Thoughts:** As I mentioned in an earlier post, I chose the GitHub Quickstart doc to recreate as my project. I'll attempt to style it along the same lines as the actual GitHub page, but not identical. I don't want to inspect any of the original page's code, just try to make mine similar but different.

### Day X: April 21, 2023
##### *Trying Friday's as a Rest Day*

**Today's Progress**: After some consideration I've decided to make Friday my day off; Fridays will be for reviewing what I did that week and pushing my logs from local to GitHub.

**Thoughts:**  I really benefit from having one day of not having to worry about it for now. Or that's the theory. Will try it out for three weeks or so.
