# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 10, 2023
##### *Getting to know Github*

**Today's Progress**: Worked through part of the tutorial offered by Github to familiarize yourself with the site. Forked the 100-days-of-code repository to begin this log. While there was some active code work, this was more a read and learn day.

**Thoughts:** Like a lot of new topics under the huge umbrella of computer science, Git and Github seem overwhelming to me at first. But even after a short time parts of it are already becoming more familiar. Tomorrow I should finish setting up my Hello World repository so I can begin logging exercises, projects and guided tutorials.

**Link to work:** N/A, as the landing page would be right here!

### Day 2: April 11, 2023
##### *Git, GitHub and GitDesktop*

**Today's Progress**: More Github stuff today! Went through the quickstart, creating repositories just to play around with pull requests, branches, merging etc. Downloaded GitHub Desktop and did half of the exercise there to start getting familiar.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'm going to continue with a Git tutorial and uploading an HTML project via Git to get used to these tools. After that I think back to my current FCC project: Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting.

**Link to work:** [Here](https://github.com/MojoBoingo/hello-world) is a link to my little hello-world repository: currently only populated by a README file listing some basic goals and plans I have for the immediate future. If you want to push some learning suggestions to the main branch, feel free!
